# **Analysis of Popular YouTube Videos** #

**Project Description**

The purpose of this project is to analyze the topics and sentiment of popular YouTube videos and the comments viewers have left on those videos. YouTube has become a worldwide popular source for information about a variety of topics, for better or for worse. With the following data, I intend to analyze what topics are popular with users. Within the data, all videos are assigned a keyword and that keyword will serve as the main topic of every video. Additionally, I will look at the comments left under these videos and analyze the sentiment behind them. After all, there isn't a corner of the internet where users aren't willing to share their opinion on the content they're consuming. I will use this project to determine if that sentiment is more often positive or negative.

The data used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaypatil/youtube-statistics).
